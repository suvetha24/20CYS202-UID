<marquee style="color:red">“Some relationships are like Tom and Jerry: They tease each other, knock down each other, irritate each other, but can’t live without each other!”</marquee>
<p>Siblings are more like friends who never leave us alone. Most of us have a brother or a sister. The brother-sister bond is a special one. Even though they constantly argue, they share a deep friendship, and this friendship is the best thing one can ever ask for.<br>
<h2>About him:</h2>
I have a younger brother. His name is chittesh, and he is 16 years old. He is a class 11th student of veveaham  school. He is an intelligent child who also excels in sports. Cricket is his favourite sport. He has won many medals . He is a jolly kid who is loved by everyone. After coming back from school, we both play together.<br>
<h2>Games:</h2>
Our favourite indoor game is Carom. Evenings are always fun with him. His funny gestures make everyone happy. Being the youngest member of the family, he is the apple of everyone’s eyes. He  hardly gets angry. However, once a friend of mine was mocking me, and he came to my rescue. That was an instance when he was furious.<br>
<h2>favourite:</h2>
His thoughtfulness makes him a wonderful person. He is the sweetest younger brother. I honestly cannot imagine growing up without him. He has many friends. In school, he has always been popular. However, he loves to spend time alone. At home, I would often catch him reading comic books. He also likes to draw cartoons. He loves to watch animated movies. Finding Nemo is his favourite movie.<br>
<h2>Hobbies:</h2>
His other hobbies include gardening. He has always been a gentle kid. He has a caring personality. While watering the plants, he would often sing a lullaby. Besides this, he loves eating tasty food. We always go to the nearby store and get ice creams. He also is a big fan of chocolates. The relationship between my brother and me is deep and special.<br>
It only grows stronger with time. There are occasional fights and arguments. But at the end of the day, chittesh and I are always looking after each other. Having my little brother in my life is an amazing gift. Being an older sister, I am responsible for his well-being. I try my best to keep him happy and positive. I love my brother. I wish he gets all the happiness he deserves and more. He is my hero.<br>
<h2>Campanion:</h2>
Brothers are mischievous. Sometimes they can be annoying, but their presence matters. We simply cannot live without them. No matter how many times you fight with them, the very next day everything would be fine. Unlike friends, they don’t leave your side. They are our forever companions.<br>
