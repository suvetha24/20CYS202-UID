<p>My father is my world… <br><br><br>
My father is my best friend. He is best guardian and best father in the entire world. He is a superhero who always stands with me. He is a best teacher who helps me to compete the struggles facing in life and makes me to learn various new things. He is also a best manger who manages all family expenses and save a small amount for future in his small salary that he get from his office. He is my Santa Claus who gives me exciting new gifts and all necessary things which are required. Overall he is my inspiration who manage all family works and performs excellent in his office duty as well.<br><br>
My father works hard in day and night to keep our family happy. In every vacation time we used to visit different places and enjoy our holidays.One of the best things I love about my father is that he has always kept a very safe and open home environment. For instance, my siblings and I can talk about anything with him without the fear of being scolded or judged. This has helped us not to lie, which I have often noticed with my friends.<br><br>
Every Sunday my father takes me out along with family members. We enjoy visiting parks, shopping malls, temples, monuments and science museum. We also play Cricket with my father every Sunday. Overall he is my inspiration and everything. He always motivates me to be successful in life by hard work and smart work.<br><br>
I believe that my father has it all what it takes to be called a real-life superhero. The way he manages things professionally and personally leaves me mesmerized every time. No matter how tough the times got, I watched my father become tougher. I certainly aspire to become like my father. If I could just inherit ten percent of what he is, I believe my life will be sorted.
