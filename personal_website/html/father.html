<p>My father is my world… <br><br><br>
Fathers are one of the most influential people in our family. Every father is unique and special. They teach us to be reliable as well as caring. Daughters feel safe and secure with their fathers, just like how my father makes me feel. Sons want to be like their fathers and try to behave just like them. Fathers influence who we make friends with and how we interact with people around us.<br><br>
My father has always taught me to be independent and brave. Fathers help us to solve problems by taking more risks in our lives. Today, fathers are not just breadwinners. Many mothers pursue their careers while fathers also help around the house and are supportive of mothers. My father has always respected my mother’s job and helped her around the house.<br><br>
Fathers may appear tough, but they are also there for us when we need them. My father has always been a constant support and at the same time, has enforced rules so that I become more responsible. Every year on the third Sunday of June, Father’s Day s celebrated to thank our fathers for what they do for us. Whether it is a card or a gift or even a simple wish, thank your fathers.
