<h2>Find the lag</h2>
<h2>About:</h2>
<p>With the input lag being an essential factor for gamers, we can safely say that every millisecond counts. The lower the lag, the faster the response to your actions, setting the targeted value between 50-75 ms. Anything over 80 ms is considered to be inadequate.<br><br>

With this in mind, participating teams are expected to design an ML Model/ any other software/ innovative techniques measuring the lag between the input through the mouse and output on the screen.</p>
